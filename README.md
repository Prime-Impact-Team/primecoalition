This module provides a comprehensive suite of functions designed for manipulating, calculating, and visualizing data related to impact scenarios. 

The functions in this module can be used for a wide range of data manipulation and analysis tasks. For example, you can use the setup functions to create and initialize DataFrames, 
helping functions to preprocess and transform the data, data functions to manage and operate on data columns, market penetration functions to model market behavior, 
growth/recovery functions to project future trends, calculation functions to generate new metrics, impact scenario functions to analyze different scenarios, and visualization functions to create informative plots and tables.

Each function is designed to be modular and reusable, allowing for flexible and efficient data analysis workflows.

For detailed information on each function's parameters and examples, use the help function or refer to the docstrings provided.
